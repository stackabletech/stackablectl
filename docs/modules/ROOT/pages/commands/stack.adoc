= Stack

A stack is a collection of ready-to-use Stackable data products as well as required third-party services like Postgresql or MinIO.
It is tied to a specific release of the Stackable data platform, which will provide the required operators for the stack.

== Browse available stacks
To list the available stacks, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack list
STACK                               STACKABLE RELEASE  DESCRIPTION
druid-superset-s3                   22.06              Stack containing MinIO, Druid and Superset for data visualization
airflow                             22.06              Stack containing Airflow scheduling platform
----

Detailed information of a stack can be queried with the `describe` command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack describe druid-superset-s3
Stack:              druid-superset-s3
Description:        Stack containing MinIO, Druid and Superset for data visualization
Stackable release:  22.06
Labels:             druid, superset, minio, s3
----

Future version of `stackablectl` will also allow to search for stacks based on the labels.

== Install stack
=== Using existing Kubernetes cluster
If you want to access a Kubernetes cluster, make sure your https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[`kubectl`] Kubernetes client is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
After that run the following command

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack install druid-superset-s3
[INFO ] Installing stack druid-superset-s3
[INFO ] Installing release 22.06
[INFO ] Installing airflow operator in version 0.4.0

[INFO ] Installing hdfs operator in version 0.4.0
[INFO ] Installing hive operator in version 0.6.0
[INFO ] Installing kafka operator in version 0.6.0
[INFO ] Installing nifi operator in version 0.6.0

[INFO ] Installing zookeeper operator in version 0.10.0
[INFO ] Installing components of stack druid-superset-s3
[INFO ] Installed stack druid-superset-s3
----

=== Using local kind cluster
If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster available, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] Kubernetes cluster for you.
Make sure you have `kind` installed and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack install druid-superset-s3 --kind-cluster
[INFO ] Creating kind cluster stackable-data-platform
Creating cluster "stackable-data-platform" ...

Set kubectl context to "kind-stackable-data-platform"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-stackable-data-platform

Have a nice day! üëã

=== List deployed services
After installing your stack you can use the xref:commands/services.adoc[] command to list the installed services as follows

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl services list --all-namespaces
