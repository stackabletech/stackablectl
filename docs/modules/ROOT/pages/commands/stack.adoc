= Stack
A stack is a collection of ready-to-use Stackable data products as well as needed third-party services like Postgresql or MinIO.

== Browse available stacks
To list the available stacks, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack list
STACK                               STACKABLE RELEASE  DESCRIPTION
druid-superset-s3                   22.06              Stack containing MinIO, Druid and Superset for data visualization
airflow                             22.06              Stack containing Airflow scheduling platform
----

To show details run

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack describe druid-superset-s3
Stack:              druid-superset-s3
Description:        Stack containing MinIO, Druid and Superset for data visualization
Stackable release:  22.06
Labels:             druid, superset, minio, s3
----

Future version of `stackablectl` will allow to search for stacks based on the labels.

== Install stack
If you access to an Kubernetes cluster make sure your https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[`kubectl`] Kubernetes client is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
After that run the following command

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack install druid-superset-s3
[INFO ] Installing release 22.06
[INFO ] Installing airflow operator in version 0.4.0
[INFO ] Installing commons operator in version 0.2.0

----

If you don't have an Kubernetes cluster available `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] Kubernetes cluster for you.
Make sure you have https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] installed and run the following command

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stack install druid-superset-s3 --kind-cluster
[INFO ] Creating kind cluster stackable-data-platform
Creating cluster "stackable-data-platform" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.21.1) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦 📦 📦 📦  
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜

 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 
 ✓ Joining worker nodes 🚜 
Set kubectl context to "kind-stackable-data-platform"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-stackable-data-platform

After installing the stack, we can access the running services using the xref:commands/operator.adoc[] command:

== Uninstall stack
Currently there is no support for uninstalling a stack again.
Maybe a solution would be to uninstall the components of the stack but leave the release running.
