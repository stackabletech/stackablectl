= Demo

A demo is an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the Stackable data platform.
It is tied to a specific stack of the Stackable data platform, which will provide the required products for the demo.

== Browse available demos
To list the available demos, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo list
DEMO                                STACKABLE STACK           DESCRIPTION
trino-taxi-data                     trino-superset-s3         Demo loading 2.5 years of New York taxi data into S3 bucket, creating a Trino table and a Superset dashboard
kafka-druid-earthquake-data         kafka-druid-superset-s3   Demo ingesting earthquake data into Kafka, streaming it into Druid and creating a Superset dashboard
----

Detailed information of a demo can be queried with the `describe` command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo describe trino-taxi-data
Demo:               trino-taxi-data
Description:        Demo loading 2.5 years of New York taxi data into S3 bucket, creating a Trino table and a Superset dashboard
Documentation:      https://docs.stackable.tech/stackablectl/stable/demos/trino-taxi-data.html
Stackable stack:    trino-superset-s3
Labels:             trino, superset, minio, s3, ny-taxi-data
----

Future versions of `stackablectl` will also allow to search for demos based on the labels.

== Install demo
=== Using existing Kubernetes cluster
If you want to access a Kubernetes cluster, make sure your https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[`kubectl`] Kubernetes client is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
After that run the following command

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data

=== Using local kind cluster
If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster available, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] Kubernetes cluster for you.
Make sure you have `kind` installed and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data --kind-cluster
[INFO ] Creating kind cluster stackable-data-platform

You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-stackable-data-platform

----

The demos create Kubernetes jobs, that will populate test data and interact with the installed products to process the data.
Until the products are ready, it is completely normal that the pods of these Jobs will fail with an error.
They will get retried with an exponentially growing backoff time.
After the products are ready they should turn green and everything should settle down.

=== List deployed services
After installing your demo you can use the xref:commands/services.adoc[] command to list the installed services as follows:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl services list --all-namespaces
