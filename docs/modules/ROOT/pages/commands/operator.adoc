= Operator

The `stackable operator` command allows to list, install and uninstall Stackable operators.
Operators manage the individual data products the Stackable Data Platform consists of.

This command manages individual operators.
It is mainly intended for persons already having experience or working on the Stackable Data Platform.
If you just want an easy way to get started or don't know which products and/or which version to install it is recommended to use the xref:commands/release.adoc[] command.
This command will install a bundle of operators from an official Stackable Release.

== Browse available operators
To list the operators that are part of the Stackable Data Platform as well as their stable versions run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl operator list

This command only includes the stable versions for every operator to not mess up the whole screen.
If you're interested in a special version of an operator you can use the `describe` command to get more details for a specific operator as follows:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl operator describe airflow
Operator:           airflow
Stable versions:    0.4.0, 0.3.0, 0.2.0, 0.1.0
Test versions:      0.5.0-pr135, 0.5.0-pr134, 0.5.0-pr133, 0.5.0-pr132, 0.5.0-pr131, 0.5.0-pr130, 0.5.0-pr129, 0.5.0-pr128, 0.5.0-pr127, 0.5.0-pr126, 0.5.0-pr125, 0.5.0-pr122, 0.4.0-pr123, 0.4.0-pr122, 0.4.0-pr121, 0.4.0-pr120, 0.4.0-pr119, 0.4.0-pr118, 0.4.0-pr117

== Install operator
If you want to access a Kubernetes cluster, make sure your https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[`kubectl`] Kubernetes client is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
After that run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl operator install airflow commons secret
[INFO ] Installing airflow operator
[INFO ] Installing commons operator
[INFO ] Installing secret operator
----

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster available, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] Kubernetes cluster for you.
Make sure you have `kind` installed and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl operator install airflow commons secret --kind-cluster
[INFO ] Creating kind cluster stackable-data-platform

With this command we installed the operator for Apache Airflow as well as two operators needed internally by the Stackable Data Platform (commons and secret).

As we didn't specify a specific version to install the operators were installed in the latest nightly version - build from the main branch of the operator.

If you want to install a specific version you can add the version to each operator to install as follows

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl operator install airflow=0.4.0 commons=0.2.0 secret=0.5.0
[INFO ] Installing airflow operator in version 0.4.0
[INFO ] Installing commons operator in version 0.2.0
[INFO ] Installing secret operator in version 0.5.0
----

As you can see, the three operators where installed in the requested version.

Remember: If you want to install a recommended and tested set of operator versions, have a look at the xref:commands/release.adoc[] command.

== List installed operators
After installing some operators, you can list which operators are installed in you Kubernetes cluster.

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl operator installed
OPERATOR              VERSION         NAMESPACE                      STATUS           LAST UPDATED
