= logging

This demo will

* Install the required Stackable operators
* Spin up the follow data products:
** *Apache ZooKeeper*: A centralized service for maintaining configuration
information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group
services. This demo makes its log data observable in OpenSearch Dashboards.
** *Vector*: A tool for building observability pipelines. This demo uses Vector
as a log agent to gather and transform the logs and as an aggregator to forward
the collected logs to OpenSearch.
** *OpenSearch*: A data store and search engine. This demo uses it to store and
index the log data.
** *OpenSearch Dashboards*: A visualization and user interface. This demo uses
it to make the log data easily accessible to the user.
* Create a view in OpenSearch Dashboards for convenient browsing the log data.

You can see the deployed products as well as their relationship in the
following diagram:

== OpenSearch prerequisites

OpenSearch uses a mmapfs directory by default to store its indices. The default
operating system limits on mmap counts is likely to be too low – usually 65530,
which may result in out of memory exceptions. So the Linux setting
`vm.max_map_count` on the host machine where kind is running, must be set to at
least 262144.

[NOTE]
====
If you are on a Mac, the commands in this section won’t work for you. You can
skip it, and continue with the rest of the tutorial. They are not strictly
necessary to get a working prototype going.
====

To check the current value, run this command:

[source,console]
----
sysctl vm.max_map_count
----

The limit can be temporarily increased with:

[source,console]
----
sudo sysctl --write vm.max_map_count=262144
----

To permanently increase the value, add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

[source,.properties]
----
vm.max_map_count=262144
----

Then run `sudo sysctl --load` to reload.

== Run the demo

The following command creates a kind cluster and installs this demo:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install logging --kind-cluster
----

== List deployed Stackable services

To list the installed Stackable services run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl services list

[NOTE]
====
When a product instance has not finished starting yet, the service will have no
endpoint. Starting all the product instances might take a considerable amount
of time depending on your internet connectivity. In case the product is not
ready yet, a warning might be shown.

== Inspect the log data

You can have a look at the log data within the OpenSearch Dashboards web
interface by running `stackablectl services list` and opening the URL shown in
the info column of the `opensearch-dashboards` entry. In this case it is
http://172.18.0.5:31319/app/discover?security_tenant=global#/view/logs.

// image::logging/login.png[]
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/stackablectl/logging/docs/modules/ROOT/images/logging/login.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

// image::logging/logs.png[]
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/stackablectl/logging/docs/modules/ROOT/images/logging/logs.png[]

Inspect the logs.
