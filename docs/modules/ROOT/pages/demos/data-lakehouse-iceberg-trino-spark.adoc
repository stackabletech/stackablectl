= data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark

[WARNING]
====
This demo shows a data workload with real world data volumes and uses significant amount of resources to ensure acceptable response times.
It will most likely not run on your workstation. It was developed and tested on a kubernetes cluster with 10 nodes (4 cores (8 threads), 20GB RAM and 30GB HDD).

Instance types that loosely correspond to this on the Hyperscalers are:

- *Google*: `e2-standard-8`
- *Azure*: `Standard_D4_v2`
- *AWS*: `m5.2xlarge`

In addition to these nodes the operators will request multiple persistent volumes with a total capacity of about 1TB.

A smaller version of this demo might be created in the future.
====

[NOTE]
====
This guide assumes that you already have the demo `data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark` installed.
If you don't have it installed please follow the xref:commands/demo.adoc#_install_demo[documentation on how to install a demo].
To put it simply you have to run `stackablectl demo install data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark`.
====

This demo will

* Install the required Stackable operators
* Spin up the following data products
** *Trino*: A fast distributed SQL query engine for big data analytics that helps you explore your data universe. This demo uses it to enable SQL access to the data
** *Apache Spark*: A multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning. This demo uses it to stream data from Kafka into the lakehouse
** *MinIO*: A S3 compatible object store. This demo uses it as persistent storage to store all the data used
** *Apache Kafka*: A distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics and data integration. This demos uses it as an event streaming platform to stream the data in near real-time
** *Apache NiFi*: An easy-to-use, powerful system to process and distribute data. This demos uses it to fetch multiple online real-time data sources and ingest it into Kafka
** *Apache Hive metastore*: A service that stores metadata related to Apache Hive and other services. This demo uses it as metadata storage for Trino and Spark
** *Open policy agent* (OPA): An open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. This demo uses it as the authorizer for Trino, which decides which user is able to query which data.
** *Apache Superset*: A modern data exploration and visualization platform. This demo utilizes Superset to retrieve data from Trino via SQL queries and build dashboards on top of that data
* Copy multiple data sources in CSV and Parquet format into the S3 staging area
* Let Trino copy the data from staging area into the lakehouse area. During the copy transformations such as validating, casting, parsing timestamps and enriching the data by joining lookup-tables are done
* Simultaneously start a NiFi workflow, which fetches datasets in real-time via the internet and ingests the data as JSON records into Kafka
* Spark structured streaming job is started, which streams the data out of Kafka into the lakehouse
* Create Superset dashboards for visualization of the different datasets

You can see the deployed products as well as their relationship in the following diagram:

== Apache Iceberg
As Apache Iceberg states on their https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/[website]:

> Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. Iceberg adds tables to compute engines including Spark, Trino, PrestoDB, Flink, Hive and Impala using a high-performance table format that works just like a SQL table.

This demos uses Iceberg as it plays along nicely with object storage as well as having a Trino and Spark integration.
In also provides the following benefits among other things over simply putting https://parquet.apache.org/[Apache Parquet] files in S3 using the https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html[Hive connector]:

* *Standardized specification how to store tables:*
Using this standardized specification multiple tools such as Trino, Spark and Flink and read and write Iceberg tables.

* *Versioned tables with snapshots, time travel and rollback mechanisms*

* *Row level updates and deletes:*
Deletes will be written as separate files for best performance and will be compacted with the mechanism described below.

* *Built in compaction:*
It is recommended to run some table maintenance functions such as compacting smaller files (including delete files) into larger files for best query performance.
Iceberg offers out-of-the-box tools for this.

* *Hidden partitioning:*
Image you have a table `sales (day varchar, ts timestamp)` partitioned by `day`.
Lot's of times users would run a statement such as `select count(\*) where ts > now() - interval 1 day` resulting in a full table scan as the partition column `day` was not filtered in the query.
Iceberg resolves this problem by using hidden partitions.
In Iceberg your table would look like `sales (ts timestamp) with (partitioning = ARRAY['day(ts)'])`.
The column `day` is not needed anymore, and the query `select count(\*) where ts > now() - interval 1 day` would use partition pruning as expected to only read one the partitions from today and yesterday.

If you want to read more on the motivation and the working principles on Iceberg, please have a read on there https://iceberg.apache.org[website] or https://github.com/apache/iceberg/[GitHub repo].

----

[NOTE]
====
When a product instance has not finished starting yet, the service will have no endpoint.
Starting all the product instances might take a considerable amount of time depending on your internet connectivity.
In case the product is not ready yet a warning might be shown.
====

== MinIO
=== List buckets
The S3 provided by MinIO is used as persistent storage to store all the data used.
Open the `minio` endpoint `console-http` retrieved by `stackablectl services list` in your browser (http://217.160.222.211:31429 in this case).

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/minio_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/minio_2.png[]

Here you can see the two buckets contained in the S3:

1. `staging`: The demo loads static datasets into this area. It is stored in different formats, such as CSV and Parquet. It does contain actual data tables as well as lookup tables.
2. `lakehouse`: This bucket is where the cleaned and/or aggregated data resides. The data is stored in the https://iceberg.apache.org/[Apache Iceberg] table format.

=== Inspect lakehouse
Click on the blue button `Browse` on the bucket `lakehouse`.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/minio_3.png[]

You can see multiple folders (called prefixes in S3) - each containing a different dataset.

Click on the folders `house-sales` afterwards the folder starting with `house-sales-*` afterwards 'data'.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/minio_4.png[]

As you can see the table `house-sales` is partitioned by day.
Go ahead and click on any folder.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/minio_5.png[]

You can see that Trino has placed a single file here containing all the house sales of that particular year.

== NiFi

NiFi is used to fetch multiple datasources from the internet and ingest it into Kafka near-realtime.
Some data sources are statically downloaded (e.g. as CSV) and others are dynamically fetched via APIs such as REST APIs.
This includes the following data sources:

* https://www.pegelonline.wsv.de/webservice/guideRestapi[Water level measurements in Germany] (real-time)
* https://mobidata-bw.de/dataset/bikesh[Shared bikes in Germany] (real-time)
* https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads[House sales in UK] (static)
* https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes[Registered earthquakes worldwide] (static)
* https://mobidata-bw.de/dataset/e-ladesaulen[E-charging stations in Germany] (static)
* https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page[NewYork taxi data] (static)

=== View ingestion jobs
You can have a look at the ingestion job running in NiFi by opening the given `nifi` endpoint `https` from your `stackablectl services list` command output (https://217.160.120.117:31499 in this case).
If you get a warning regarding the self-signed certificate generated by the xref:secret-operator::index.adoc[Secret Operator] (e.g. `Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead`), you have to tell your browser to trust the website and continue.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/nifi_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/nifi_2.png[]

As you can see, the NiFi workflow consists of lots of components.
You can zoom in by using your mouse and mouse wheel.
On the left side are two strands, that

1. Fetch the list of known water-level stations and ingest them into Kafka
2. Continuously run a loop fetching the measurements of the last 30 for every measuring station and ingesting the measurements into Kafka

On the right side are three strands, that

1. Fetch the current shared bike stations information
2. Fetch the current shared bike stations status
3. Fetch the current shared bike bike status

For details on the NiFi workflow ingesting water-level data please read on the xref:demos/nifi-kafka-druid-water-level-data.adoc#_nifi[nifi-kafka-druid-water-level-data documentation on NiFi].

== Spark

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html[Spark Structured Streaming] is used to stream data from Kafka into the lakehouse.

=== Access webinterface
To have access to the Spark WebUI you need to run the following command to port-forward the Port 4040 to your local machine

[source,console]
----
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod -o name | grep 'spark-ingest-into-lakehouse-.*-driver') 4040
----

Afterwards you can reach the Webinterface on http://localhost:4040.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/spark_1.png[]

=== List running streaming jobs

On the UI the last jobs are shown.
Each running Structured Streaming job creates lots of Spark jobs internally.

Click on the tab `Structured Streaming` to see the running streaming jobs.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/spark_2.png[]

Five streaming jobs are currently running.
You can also click on a streaming job to get more details.
For the job `ingest smart_city shared_bikes_station_status` click on the `Run ID` highlighted in blue to open them up.

image::demo-data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/spark_3.png[]

=== How the streaming jobs work
All the running streaming jobs have been started by the demo, to see the actual code submitted to Spark have a look in the https://github.com/stackabletech/stackablectl/blob/main/demos/data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark/create-spark-ingestion-job.yaml[demos code].
This document will explain one specific ingestion job - `ingest water_level measurements`.

The streaming job is written in Python using `pyspark`.
First off the schema used to parse the JSON coming from Kafka is defined.
Nested structures or arrays are supported as well.
This differs from job to job.

[source,python]
----
schema = StructType([ \
    StructField("station_uuid", StringType(), True), \
    StructField("timestamp", TimestampType(), True), \
    StructField("value", FloatType(), True), \
])
----

Afterwards, a streaming read from Kafka is started.
It reads from our Kafka at the address `kafka:9092`and the topic called `water_levels_measurements`.
When starting up the job will ready all the already existing messages in Kafka (read from `earliest`) and will process `50000000` records as a maximum in a single batch.
As the Kafka has a retention set up, Kafka records might alter out if the topic, before Spark has read the records.
This can be the case when the Spark application was shut down or crashed for too long.
In that case of this demo the streaming job should not error out.
For a production job `failOnDataLoss` should be set to `true`, so that missing data does not get unnoticed - and Kafka offsets need to be adjusted manually as well as maybe some post-loading of data.

Note: All of the following Python snippets belong to a single Python statement but are spilled into separate blocks for better explanation purposes.

[source,python]
----
spark \
.readStream \
.format("kafka") \
.option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:9092") \
.option("subscribe", "water_levels_measurements") \
.option("startingOffsets", "earliest") \
.option("maxOffsetsPerTrigger", 50000000) \
.option("failOnDataLoss", "false") \
.load() \
----

So far we have a `readStream` reading from Kafka.
Records on Kafka are simply a byte-stream, so they must be converted to strings and the json needs to be parsed.

[source,python]
----
.selectExpr("cast(key as string)", "cast(value as string)") \
.withColumn("json", from_json(col("value"), schema)) \
----

Afterwards we only select the needed fields (coming from JSON).
We are not interested in all the other fields such as `key`, `value`, `topic` or `offset`.
If you are interested in the metadata of the Kafka records, such as topic, timestamp, partition and offset they are available as well.
Please have a look at the https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-kafka-integration.html[Spark streaming documentation on Kafka].

[source,python]
----
.select("json.station_uuid", "json.timestamp", "json.value") \
----

After all this transformations we need to specify the sink of the stream, in this case the Iceberg lakehouse.
We are writing in the `iceberg` format using the `update` mode rather than the "normal" `append` mode.
Spark will aim for a microbatch every `2 minutes` and will save it's checkpoints (it's current offsets on the Kafka topic) in the specified S3 location.
Afterwards the streaming job will be started by calling `.start()`

[source,python]
----
.writeStream \
.queryName("ingest water_level measurements") \
.format("iceberg") \
.foreachBatch(upsertWaterLevelsMeasurements) \
.outputMode("update") \
.trigger(processingTime='2 minutes') \
.option("checkpointLocation", "s3a://lakehouse/water-levels/checkpoints/measurements") \
.start()
----

=== Deduplication mechanism
One important part was skipped during the walkthrough:

[source,python]
----
.foreachBatch(upsertWaterLevelsMeasurements) \
----

`upsertWaterLevelsMeasurements` is a Python function that describes how to insert the records coming from Kafka into the lakehouse table.

This specific streaming job removes all duplicate records, that can occur because of how the PegelOnline API works and gets called.
As we don't want duplicate rows in our lakehouse tables, we need to filter the duplicates out as follows.

[source,python]
----
def upsertWaterLevelsMeasurements(microBatchOutputDF, batchId):
    microBatchOutputDF.createOrReplaceTempView("waterLevelsMeasurementsUpserts")

    microBatchOutputDF._jdf.sparkSession().sql("""
    MERGE INTO lakehouse.water_levels.measurements as t
    USING (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM waterLevelsMeasurementsUpserts) as u
    ON u.station_uuid = t.station_uuid AND u.timestamp = t.timestamp
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *
    """)
----

First of the dataframe containing the upserts (records coming from Kafka) will be registered as a temporary view, so they can be access via Spark SQL.
Afterwards the `MERGE INTO` statement is used to add the new records to the lakehouse table.

The incoming records are first de-duplicated (using `SELECT DISTINCT * FROM waterLevelsMeasurementsUpserts`), so that the data from Kafka does not contain duplicates.
Afterwards the - now duplication free - records get added to the `lakehouse.water_levels.measurements`, but **only** if they are not already present.

=== Upsert mechanism
The `MERGE INTO` statement can not only be used for de-duplicating data but also for updating existing rows in the lakehouse table.
The `ingest water_level stations` streaming job uses the following `MERGE INTO` statement:

[source,sql]
----
MERGE INTO lakehouse.water_levels.stations as t
USING
    (
    SELECT station_uuid, number, short_name, long_name, km, agency, latitude, longitude, water_short_name, water_long_name
    FROM waterLevelsStationInformationUpserts
    WHERE (station_uuid, kafka_timestamp) IN (SELECT station_uuid, max(kafka_timestamp) FROM waterLevelsStationInformationUpserts GROUP BY station_uuid)
    ) as u
ON u.station_uuid = t.station_uuid
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *
----

First of the data within a batch is de-deduplicated as well.
The record containing station update with the highest Kafka timestamp is the freshest update and will be used during Upsert.

In case a record for a station (detected by the same `station_uud`) already exists, it's contents will be updated.
In case the station is not known yet, it will be simply inserted.
The `MERGE INTO` also supports updating a subsets of fields and more complex calculation e.g. incrementing a counter.
For details have a look at the https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-writes/#merge-into[Iceberg MERGE INTO documentation].

=== Delete mechanism
The `MERGE INTO` statement also supports deleting rows from the lakehouse tables.
For details have a look at the https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-writes/#merge-into[Iceberg MERGE INTO documentation].

=== Table maintenance
As mentioned in the beginning, Iceberg supports out-of-the-box https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures/#metadata-management[table maintenance] such as compaction.

This demos executes some maintenance functions in a very basic Python loop with sleeps in between.
For production the maintenance can be scheduled using Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/[CronJobs] or using https://airflow.apache.org/[Apache Airflow], which is also supported by the Stackable Data Platform.

[source,python]
----
# key: table name
# value: compaction strategy
tables_to_compact = {
    "lakehouse.water_levels.stations": "",
    "lakehouse.water_levels.measurements": ", strategy => 'sort', sort_order => 'timestamp DESC NULLS LAST,station_uuid ASC NULLS LAST'",
    "lakehouse.smart_city.shared_bikes_station_information": "",
    "lakehouse.smart_city.shared_bikes_station_status": ", strategy => 'sort', sort_order => 'last_reported DESC NULLS LAST,station_id ASC NULLS LAST'",
    "lakehouse.smart_city.shared_bikes_bike_status": "",
}

while True:
    expire_before = (datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=12)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    for table, table_compaction_strategy in tables_to_compact.items():
        print(f"[{table}] Expiring snapshots older than 12 hours ({expire_before})")
        spark.sql(f"CALL lakehouse.system.expire_snapshots(table => '{table}', older_than => TIMESTAMP '{expire_before}', retain_last => 50, stream_results => true)")

        print(f"[{table}] Removing orphaned files")
        spark.sql(f"CALL lakehouse.system.remove_orphan_files(table => '{table}')")

        print(f"[{table}] Starting compaction")
        spark.sql(f"CALL lakehouse.system.rewrite_data_files(table => '{table}'{table_compaction_strategy})")
        print(f"[{table}] Finished compaction")

    print("All tables compacted. Waiting 25min before scheduling next run...")
    time.sleep(25 * 60) # Assuming compaction takes 5 min run every 30 minutes
----

The scripts has a dictionary of all the tables to run maintenance on.
The following procedures are run:

==== https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures/#expire_snapshots[expire_snapshots]

> Each write/update/delete/upsert/compaction in Iceberg produces a new snapshot while keeping the old data and metadata around for snapshot isolation and time travel. The expire_snapshots procedure can be used to remove older snapshots and their files which are no longer needed.

==== https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures/#remove_orphan_files[remove_orphan_files]

> Used to remove files which are not referenced in any metadata files of an Iceberg table and can thus be considered “orphaned”.

==== https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures/#rewrite_data_files[rewrite_data_files]

> Iceberg tracks each data file in a table. More data files leads to more metadata stored in manifest files, and small data files causes an unnecessary amount of metadata and less efficient queries from file open costs. Iceberg can compact data files in parallel using Spark with the rewriteDataFiles action. This will combine small files into larger files to reduce metadata overhead and runtime file open cost.

Some tables will also be sorted during rewrite, please have a look at the https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures/#rewrite_data_files[documentation on rewrite_data_files].

There are multiple other dashboards you can explore on you own.

=== View charts

The dashboards consists of multiple charts.
To list the charts click on the tab `Charts` at the top.

=== Execute arbitrary SQL statements
Within Superset you can not only create dashboards but also run arbitrary SQL statements.
On the top click on the tab `SQL Lab` -> `SQL Editor`.
