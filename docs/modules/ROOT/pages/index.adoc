= stackablectl

The `stackablectl` command line tool is used to interact with the Stackable data platform.
It can install individual operators as well as platform releases.
It also ships with a set of pre-built xref:commands/demo.adoc[] that utilize different data products of the Platform to get e.g. an end-to-end data pipeline.

The installation of `stackablectl` is described in xref:installation.adoc[].

To just get a Quickstart please follow xref:quickstart.adoc[].

In general, use `stackablectl --help` to find out more about how to use the tool or how to use specific options.
This also works with subcommands, i.e. `stackablectl release install --help` will show the help for installing a release.
Often you can also use an abbreviation instead of typing out all of the commands.
E.g. `stackablectl operator list` can also be written as `stackablectl op ls`

A Kubernetes cluster is required in order to use the Stackable Data Platform as all products and operators run on Kubernetes.
If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] Kubernetes Cluster for you.

The deployed services are separated into three different layers as illustrated below:

image::layers.png[Layers of the deployed services]

== Operators
This layer consists of Stackable operators managing the individual data products.
They can either be installed one by one with the xref:commands/operator.adoc[] command or from a release with the xref:commands/release.adoc[] command which is recommended way.
A release is a well-playing bundle of operators that has been extensively tested by Stackable.

== Stacks
A stack is a collection of ready-to-use Stackable data products as well as needed third-party services like Postgresql or MinIO.

Stacks are installed with the xref:commands/stack.adoc[] command.
A stack needs a release (of Stackable operators) to run on.
To achieve this a stacks has a dependency on a release which gets automatically installed when a stack is installed.

== Demos
A demo is an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the Stackable data platform.
It contains

. Installing a Stackable release
. Spinning up a stack
. Performing the actual demo
.. Prepare some test data
.. Process test data
.. Visualize results (optional)

Demos are installed with the xref:commands/demo.adoc[] command.
A demo needs a stack to run on.
To achieve this a demo has a dependency on a stack which gets automatically installed when a demo is installed.
The stack in turn will install the needed Stackable release.

You can browse the available demos xref:demos/index.adoc[on the demo page].
