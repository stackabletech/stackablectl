= Quickstart

== Goal
In this Quickstart guide you will install a xref:commands/demo.adoc[], which is an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the Stackable data platform.

== Install stackablectl
Please follow the xref:installation.adoc[Installation documentation] to install `stackablectl`.

== Browse available demos
Stackable provides a set of ready-to-use demos.
As of writing (2022/09/10) only a single demo is available, but further demos will be added in the future.
They will automatically show up, as `stackablectl` fetches the available list of demos via the Internet.
To list the available demos run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demos list
DEMO                                STACKABLE STACK           DESCRIPTION
trino-taxi-data                     trino-superset-s3         Demo loading 2.5 years of New York taxi data into S3 bucket, creating a Trino table and a Superset dashboard
----

[NOTE]
====
When you are on a Windows system you have to replace the `stackablectl` command with `stackablectl.exe`, e.g. `stackablectl.exe demos list`.
This applies to all commands below.
====

For this guide we will use the xref:demos/trino-taxi-data.adoc[] demo.
The installation of other available demos should work the same way.
You simply need to use the name of the chosen demo instead of `trino-taxi-data` in the following commands.

== Install demo
The installation depends on wether you already have an Kubernetes available to run the Stackable data platform on.

=== Using existing Kubernetes cluster
If you want to access a Kubernetes cluster, make sure your https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[`kubectl`] Kubernetes client is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
After that run the following command.

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data

----

=== Using local kind cluster
If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster available, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] Kubernetes cluster for you.
Make sure you have `kind` installed and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data --kind-cluster
[INFO ] Creating kind cluster stackable-data-platform
Creating cluster "stackable-data-platform" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.21.1) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦 📦 📦 📦  
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜 
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️ 
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌 
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 
 ✓ Joining worker nodes 🚜 
Set kubectl context to "kind-stackable-data-platform"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-stackable-data-platform

Have a nice day! 👋
